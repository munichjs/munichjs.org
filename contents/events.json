Not too long ago, TypeScript 1.0 was announced at Build. This seems like an opportune time to present it at MunichJS.  TypeScript is a JavaScript superset that adds optional types to JavaScript. Hence, it allows more sophisticated type inferring which enables significantly improved development experiences. On top of that, TypeScript adds interfaces and suggests patterns for classes and promises. TypeScript is being developed by Anders Hejlsberg who created C# as well.
